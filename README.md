1Password client for Mac, written in Swift 2.0, compiled with Xcode 7 beta.

# Intro

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) is a great product, it is versatile. For desktop, the only choice is the full version of 1Password with price USD 35 (yesterday 16 June it was 49). I just need its password management features, like they provide in iOS version.

Thanks to its open format of its vault, making 3rd party tools reality. 

So I decide to make a simple and open source client which can be run on my MacBook.

Robertknight's [1pass](https://github.com/robertknight/1pass) and jbreams' [gonepass](https://github.com/jbreams/gonepass) provide as nice referrences.
